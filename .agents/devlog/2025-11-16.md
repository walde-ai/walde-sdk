## Initial Project Analysis and Agent Setup

### Request Summary
User requested to understand the project in detail by reading all source files, then populate AGENTS.md and the .agents folder structure according to agent guidelines.

### What I Did

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Examined the complete directory structure with depth-2 exploration
   - Identified clean architecture implementation with domain/infrastructure separation
   - Found TypeScript SDK with AWS integration focus

2. **Key File Analysis**
   - Read package.json: TypeScript SDK with AWS dependencies (Cognito, S3, gray-matter)
   - Examined tsconfig.json: Modern ES2022 target with strict typing
   - Analyzed main entry points: src/index.ts, src/sdk/index.ts, src/std/index.ts

3. **Domain Understanding**
   - Core entities: Site, Content, DnsEntry with clean business logic
   - Use cases: CreateSite, PushContent, ListContents, etc.
   - Error handling: Custom WaldeError hierarchy with Result<T,E> pattern
   - Ports pattern: Clear input/output port definitions

4. **Infrastructure Analysis**
   - Adapters for AWS services, HTTP clients, file systems
   - Factories for dependency injection
   - Futures pattern for fluent API chaining
   - DTO mappers for data transformation

5. **Standard Library**
   - Rust-inspired Result<T,E> for error handling
   - Option<T> for null safety
   - Future<T,P> for lazy evaluation and method chaining

6. **Created Agent Files**
   - Updated AGENTS.md with comprehensive project overview
   - Created .agents folder structure with all required directories
   - Populated overview files:
     - product.md: Mission, target users, value propositions
     - architecture.md: Clean architecture, design patterns, data flow
     - standards.md: TypeScript conventions, coding standards
     - domain-kb.md: Business domain knowledge and rules
   - Created initial devlog entry documenting this analysis

### Key Insights
- Well-structured TypeScript SDK following clean architecture principles
- Strong focus on type safety with Result/Option patterns
- AWS-native design with Cognito authentication and S3 storage
- Fluent API design using Future pattern for method chaining
- Comprehensive error handling with custom error hierarchy
- Domain-driven design with clear business boundaries

### Prompt Used
"Now understand the project in details by reading all its source files, then populate AGENTS.md and the .agents folder as per your guideline."
