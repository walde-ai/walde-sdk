# Current Context

## Task: Initial Project Setup and Documentation

### Project Understanding
The Walde SDK is a TypeScript SDK for a content management and website hosting platform with AWS integration. Key characteristics:

- **Clean Architecture**: Domain/Infrastructure separation with dependency inversion
- **Type Safety**: Result<T,E> and Option<T> patterns for error handling
- **Fluent API**: Future pattern enables method chaining with lazy evaluation
- **AWS Integration**: Cognito authentication, S3 storage, API Gateway communication
- **Content Management**: Markdown parsing, versioning, site management

### Current State
- Project has complete implementation with 116+ files
- Well-structured with domain entities, use cases, and infrastructure adapters
- Standard library provides Rust-inspired utilities
- Clean separation between business logic and external dependencies

### Next Steps
Ready to assist with any development tasks, feature additions, or maintenance work on the SDK.
